This is a repo stores scripts I created to build a home entertainment center
using RPi. The base OS is the OpenELEC which is a tiny Linux system which
integrates with the XBMC media center. This repo extends its features,
including:

* A static built Aria2 binary, which allows you download files via
  HTTP, HTTPS, torrent, Magnet, etc.

* A static built Retroarch binary, along with several pre-built Retroarch cores,
  which allows you play numerous simulation games, like NES, SNES, MAME, etc.

Please follow simple instructions written in scripts under different folders.
